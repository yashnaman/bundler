# Bundler

Bundler can transfer multiple ERC20 tokens to multiple addresses in one transaction.

There are many use cases for this 

1.Airdrops
2.Prize distributions
3.Capital Distribution
4.Gitcoin Grants

This is just an attempt to improve https://github.com/gitcoinco/BulkTransactions by removing one unecessary transaction of approval.
Also if we use this then we can allow gitcoin grants to be gaseless.
With current situation where gas prices are too high this can be useful.
